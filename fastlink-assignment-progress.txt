You're absolutely right — you've done a **fantastic** job so far! 🙌  
Here’s a final checklist of **what’s completed** and **what’s left**, based on the full requirements:

---

### ✅ **Completed**

#### 🔐 Authentication
- [x] Token-based authentication with Laravel Sanctum
- [x] Login API implemented
- [x] Register route removed (correctly — only PO creates users)

#### 👤 User Management (Product Owner only)
- [x] Create user via API (PO only)
- [x] Update user via API (PO only)
- [x] Delete user via API (PO only)
- [x] Create user via Artisan command
- [x] Authorization enforced via policies (`->can()`)

#### 📋 Task Management
- [x] Task CRUD operations
- [x] Only Product Owner can create/update/delete tasks
- [x] Developers can move tasks:
  - `TODO` → `IN PROGRESS`
  - `IN PROGRESS` → `READY FOR TEST`
- [x] Testers can move tasks:
  - `READY FOR TEST` → `PO REVIEW`
- [x] Product Owner can move tasks:
  - To `DONE`, `IN PROGRESS`, `REJECTED`
- [x] Automatic reassignment:
  - `READY FOR TEST` → Least busy tester
  - `PO REVIEW` or `REJECTED` → Creator (PO)
  - `DONE` / `IN PROGRESS` → Developer who worked on it

#### 🧠 Task Features
- [x] Subtask support (parent_id + subtasks relationship)
- [x] Logs every change to title, description, status
- [x] `GET /task/{id}` includes all details + logs + subtasks
- [x] `GET /tasks` includes:
  - Search (title, description, ID)
  - Filter by assignee (multi-select)
  - Search by assignee name

#### 🧪 Seeders
- [x] Separate user, task, and task log seeders
- [x] Seed fake data during setup

#### 🧰 Artisan Commands
- [x] Create user via command
- [X] Export tasks to CSV
- [X] Import tasks from CSV using **batch jobs**
- [X] API to check **import job progress**

#### 📧 Notifications
- [X] Background email when task is assigned to a user
- [ ] WebSocket alert when task passes due date

#### 📬 Postman
- [x] Postman collection is being structured
- [X] Set up complete collection with variables + instructions
- [X] Export and include in project root

### 🚧 Remaining (To Do)

| ❗️Item | Type |
|-------|------|
| 🔔 WebSocket alert to Product Owner when **task is overdue** | Required |
| 📤 Export final Postman collection | Required |
| 📝 API Documentation (Postman or Markdown) | Nice to have |
| ✅ Unit/Feature tests | Nice to have |
| 🐳 Docker support | Nice to have |
| 🚀 Free deployment (Render, Railway, etc.) | Nice to have |
